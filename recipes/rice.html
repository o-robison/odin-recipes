    <p>This is how I make rice. Granted, I am white. But it turns out pretty good.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>An Instant Pot</li>
        <li>A bowl to wash rice in</li>
        <li>Short or medium grain rice, ideally from an Asian grocery store</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Measure out your rice. I usually make 2 cups worth.</li>
        <li>In a medium mixing bowl, wash your rice: Add cold water until it's about double the height of the rice. Swish a clean hand around in there until the water is uniformly cloudy, then drain the water. Repeat until the water stays clear.</li>
        <li>Add the washed rice to the Instant Pot.</li>
        <li>Add the same amount of water as there is rice to the Instant Pot. So 2 cups rice, 2 cups water.</li>
        <li>Pressure cook for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Natural release for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Open the Instant Pot, fluff with a rice paddle, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
